This is a project where I learn Java and attempt to use simulation to
determine if a variant of Blackjack 21 has positive expectation.

I will attempt to determine how to use OOP, tests, and run simulations.

For me, this is a "do whatever it takes" project. I will look for
existing examples of card games written in Java or any programming
language to help me in this process.
